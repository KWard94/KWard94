# Hello! My name is Keenan Ward. I am a Full Stack Software Developer based in Salt Lake City, UT. 

## I primarily program in Javascript, with a bit of Python. I enjoy using React.js for my front end pages and Express with Mongoose or Django for my back end servers.

#### I love to create from the ground up, and to tweak and advance projects that have already been created. I am new to the world of software development but I am eager to learn as much as I can, and to advance my abilities further!

### I am currently interested in learning:
- A more advanced grasp of Python
- Mobile development languages like Swift

### I am currently interested in collaborating on:
- Contributing to open source code
